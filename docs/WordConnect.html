    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how WordConnect collects, uses, and shares your personal information when you use

        you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

    <h2>Personal Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>WordConnect does not require user login, so we do not collect any personal information such as your name, email
        address, or phone number directly from you. However, through the use of third-party services like Unity Ads,
        certain information may be collected automatically, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>Information about your interactions with the game and ads</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>The information collected through Unity Ads is used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Serve personalized advertisements</li>
        <li>Analyze user interactions to improve the game experience</li>
        <li>Support in-app purchases and other game features</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Who We Share Your Personal Information With</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. However, we may share information with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Third-party service providers like Unity Ads for advertising purposes</li>
        <li>App stores such as Google Play or Apple App Store for processing in-app purchases</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Where We Process Your Personal Information</h2>
    <p>Your personal information may be processed outside of your country of residence, including in the United States
        and other countries where our service providers operate. By using WordConnect, you consent to the transfer of
        your information to these countries.</p>


    <h2>Contact & Complaints</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions, concerns, or complaints about this Privacy Policy or our handling of your personal
        information, please contact us at ideapetal@gmail.com. We will do our best to address your concerns in a timely
        and satisfactory manner.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the date of the
        latest revision will be indicated at the top of the policy. Your continued use of WordConnect after any changes
        signifies your acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Advertising and User Acquisition Partners</h2>
    <p>We partner with third-party advertisers and user acquisition partners to promote WordConnect. These partners may
        collect and use information about your interactions with our game to serve targeted ads or analyze the
        effectiveness of advertising campaigns. Please refer to their respective privacy policies for more information.
    </p>
    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our Games are not targeted at children. Where Children under 16 use our Games, we advise that they obtain the
        permission
        of a parent or guardian, and we recommend that parents or guardians clear their browser cache of cookies and
        take all
        other steps highlighted in this policy to minimise the data collected.
    </p>

    <h2>Unity Ads</h2>
    <p>We use Unity Ads to serve advertisements in WordConnect. Unity Ads may collect data such as your device
        identifier, IP address, and information about your interactions with the ads to provide personalized
        advertisements. Unity's privacy policy can be found at <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy"
            target="_blank">Unity Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>WordConnect offers in-app purchases to enhance your gaming experience. When you make a purchase, the transaction
        is processed through the app store (e.g., Google Play or Apple App Store). We do not have access to your payment
        information. Please refer to the privacy policy of your app store for more details:</p>

    </ul>

    <h2>No User Login Required</h2>
