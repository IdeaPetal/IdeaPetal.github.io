        <h2>Coins and In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>Coins are the currency in <strong>Word Connect: Journey of Mind </strong> and are used to unlock hints or
            special features that
            help solve

        <ul>

            <li><strong>Watching Ads</strong>: Occasionally, you can earn extra coins by watching optional ads.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Coins are consumable items, meaning they are used up when you spend them on hints or features. They cannot be
            refunded once used. All purchases are processed through the Apple App Store or Google Play, depending on
            your device.</p>

        <h2>No Login Required</h2>
        <p><strong>Word Connect: Journey of Mind </strong> is designed to be simple and accessible. You don’t need to
            create an account or
            log in to play.
            Your progress is stored locally on your device. However, this means that if you uninstall the app or change
            devices, your progress and purchased coins will not transfer to the new device.</p>

        <h2>Troubleshooting and FAQs</h2>
        <h3>1. I lost my coins after reinstalling the app.</h3>
        <p>Since <strong>Word Connect: Journey of Mind </strong> does not require an account, progress and purchases are
            stored locally on
            your device. If
            the app is deleted or your device is changed, coins and game progress may be lost. Unfortunately, we are
            unable to restore lost coins or progress.</p>

        <h3>2. I didn't receive my coins after a purchase.</h3>
        <p>If you made an in-app purchase and didn’t receive your coins, please:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure your payment was successfully processed.</li>
            <li>Restart the game to refresh your coin balance.</li>
            <li>If the issue persists, feel free to reach out to us via email at <a
                    href="mailto:ideapetal@gmail.com">ideapetal@gmail.com</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Why am I seeing ads?</h3>
        <p><strong>Word Connect: Journey of Mind </strong> includes ads as part of the free game experience. Watching
            ads may provide you
            with rewards such
            as additional coins, which can help you advance in the game.</p>

        <h3>4. Can I transfer my progress to another device?</h3>
        <p>Since <strong>Word Connect: Journey of Mind </strong> doesn’t use accounts or cloud saving, progress is tied
            to your device.
            Unfortunately, it’s
            not possible to transfer progress or coins to a new device.</p>
